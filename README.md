The name of our project is called SplitterBotExpense, this was a project made during the annual run of Hack and Run organised by NUS hackers Singapore. The bot tackles the first problem that we all face from time to time - chasing and reminding your friends to buy you back your lunch/dinner money after a night out. It is essentially a bot that keep tracks and split bills amongst friends in telegram groups, which removes a user's need to individually remind people to pay their money on time.
